# Console Finances

The aim of this project is to write JavaScript code to analyse the financial records of a company. I have used the provided financial dataset in the [index.js](index.js) file to complete the analysis. The dataset provided is composed of arrays with two fields - Date and Profit/Losses.

## Financial Analysis

The process used to analyse the dataset provided are:

-   Evaluating the total number of months included in the dataset.
-   Evaluating the net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
-   Evaluating the average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
-   Evaluating the greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
-   Evaluating the greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
-   The last step is printing the resulting analysis on the Console.

## Final Result

When you open the code in the browser, the resulting analysis should look similar to the following:

```
Financial Analysis
------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $38382578
Average Change: -2315.12
Greatest Increase in Profits/Losses: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
Greatest Decrease in Profits/Losses: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
```
